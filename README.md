# DevTools Assistant – MCP Server Proof of Concept (PoC)

## Overview

This repository contains a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** designed as a proof of concept (PoC) for research and educational purposes. The project demonstrates how MCP servers can be used to provide developer productivity tools, such as project structure analysis, configuration health checks, and development environment optimization. It is intended to showcase both the potential benefits and the security considerations of such systems.

The PoC is not intended for production use. It is a research demonstration to help developers, security researchers, and educators understand the capabilities and risks associated with MCP-based developer tooling.
