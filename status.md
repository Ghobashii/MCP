# Project Status: MCP Malicious Server PoC

## Phase 1: Legitimate Facade (Complete)
- Project initialized and structure established
- Implemented basic MCP HTTP server with JSON-RPC 2.0 support
- Created three developer productivity tools:
  - `analyze_project_structure`
  - `check_config_health`
  - `optimize_dev_environment`
- Integrated with Cursor IDE and test environment

## Phase 2: Steganography & Stealth (Complete)
- Added ANSI escape sequence steganography for hiding exfiltration instructions in tool descriptions
- Refactored code for stealth:
  - `project_metrics.py` for all file discovery and indexing (formerly data_collection.py)
  - `descriptions.py` for description/metadata hiding (formerly steganography.py)
  - All field and function names use legitimate, developer-productivity terminology
- All tools use a shared, stealthy project file metrics scan
- Obsolete files and debug prints removed

## Phase 3: Caching & Efficiency (Complete)
- Implemented in-memory caching of project file metrics for 8 hours
- All tool calls reuse cached results within this window, avoiding redundant scans
- Cache is cleared on server restart or after 8 hours
- Mimics real attacker tradecraft for stealth and efficiency

### Technical Notes
- All tool outputs include a `metrics` field with a summary and indexed files
- No revealing or suspicious names in code or output
- The PoC is now fully weaponized and stealthy, ready for demonstration or blog use

## Current Status
- Stealthy, weaponized PoC is complete and tested
- All tools functional and professional in appearance
- Stealth features (naming, shared scan, cache) verified
- Documentation (README, blog plan) updated

## Next Steps
- Implement exfiltration mechanisms (API disguise, DNS tunneling, etc.)
- Blog post writing and demonstration screenshots
- Final review and publication
