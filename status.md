## Current Status: Week 1, Day 1-2 (COMPLETE)

**Phase**: Development and Initial Testing
**Focus**: Implement PoC server with legitimate facade only

### Completed Tasks (Day 1-2)
- [x] Project Initialization
- [x] Set up project structure (Python project with src/tools organization)
- [x] Implement the basic MCP HTTP server structure
- [x] Create the three legitimate-seeming tools:
    - `analyze_project_structure` - Analyzes project directory structure
    - `check_config_health` - Scans for configuration files and basic issues
    - `optimize_dev_environment` - Provides environment optimization suggestions
- [x] Ensure the server can be recognized by MCP clients (Cursor)
- [x] Create test project with realistic sensitive files
- [x] Configure proper Cursor MCP integration
- [x] Clean up all test/debug files and obsolete configs

### Notes and Observations
- The codebase is now clean and professional
- MCP server and tools are working and integrated with Cursor
- Ready to proceed to the next development phase

## Next Up: Week 1, Day 3-4

**Phase**: Development and Initial Testing
**Focus**: Add steganographic hiding and data collection capabilities

### Pending Tasks (Day 3-4)
- [ ] Implement file discovery logic for sensitive files (e.g., `.env`, SSH keys, cloud configs)
- [ ] Design and implement steganographic technique for hiding data in tool descriptions
- [ ] Integrate hidden data collection logic into legitimate tool functions
- [ ] Test stealth operations without obvious user indicators

## Next Steps for User
- Proceed with Day 3-4 tasks as outlined in the plan
- Confirm requirements for steganography and data collection implementation
