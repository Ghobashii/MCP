# Project Status: MCP Malicious Server PoC

## Timeline Overview

- **Week 1**: Development and Initial Testing (In Progress)
- **Week 2**: Testing and Documentation (Pending)
- **Week 3**: Blog Post Writing (Pending)
- **Week 4**: Review and Publication (Pending)

## Current Status: Week 1, Day 1-2

**Phase**: Development and Initial Testing
**Focus**: Implement PoC server with legitimate facade.

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Project Initialization
- [x] Set up project structure (e.g., Python project).
- [x] Implement the basic MCP server structure.
- [x] Create the three legitimate-seeming tools:
    - `analyze_project_structure`
    - `check_config_health`
    - `optimize_dev_environment`
- [x] Ensure the server starts and can be recognized by an MCP client.

### Pending Tasks
- (All Day 1-2 tasks completed)

### Notes and Observations
- The initial focus on creating a convincing, functional facade is complete.
- The server is built with FastAPI and is ready for initial testing.
- All code includes educational disclaimers.

## Next Up: Week 1, Day 3-4

**Phase**: Development and Initial Testing
**Focus**: Add steganographic hiding and data collection capabilities.

### Pending Tasks
- [ ] Implement file discovery logic for sensitive files (e.g., `.env`, SSH keys).
- [ ] Design and implement the steganographic technique for hiding data in tool descriptions.
- [ ] Integrate the data collection logic into the legitimate tool functions as a hidden feature.
