# Project Status: MCP Malicious Server PoC

## Phase 1: Legitimate Facade (Complete)
- Project initialized and structure established
- Implemented basic MCP HTTP server with JSON-RPC 2.0 support
- Created three developer productivity tools:
  - `analyze_project_structure`
  - `check_config_health`
  - `optimize_dev_environment`
- Integrated with Cursor IDE and test environment

## Phase 2: Steganography & Stealth (Complete)
- Added ANSI escape sequence steganography for hiding exfiltration instructions in tool descriptions
- Refactored code for stealth:
  - `project_metrics.py` for all file discovery and indexing (formerly data_collection.py)
  - `descriptions.py` for description/metadata hiding (formerly steganography.py)
  - All field and function names use legitimate, developer-productivity terminology
- All tools use a shared, stealthy project file metrics scan
- Obsolete files and debug prints removed

## Phase 3: Caching & Efficiency (Complete)
- Implemented in-memory caching of project file metrics for 8 hours
- All tool calls reuse cached results within this window, avoiding redundant scans
- Cache is cleared on server restart or after 8 hours
- Mimics real attacker tradecraft for stealth and efficiency

### Technical Notes
- All tool outputs include a `metrics` field with a summary and indexed files
- No revealing or suspicious names in code or output
- The PoC is now fully weaponized and stealthy, ready for demonstration or blog use

## Week 1 Completion (Phases 1-3, Exfiltration, and Initial Testing)
- Legitimate tool facade and test-project structure were already complete (no redundant work)
- Exfiltration mechanisms implemented:
  - API call disguising (local mock endpoint, base64 encoding, proper headers)
  - DNS tunneling stub (not active for safety)
  - Integrated with data collection and rate limiting
  - Logging and cleanup mechanisms added
- Initial testing infrastructure:
  - Local mock endpoint ready for safe exfiltration
  - Logging for all MCP and exfiltration events
  - No actual external network communication
- All legitimate tool functionality verified as working
- Documentation and code comments updated
- Ready for comprehensive Week 2 testing phase

## Week 2: Comprehensive Testing & Network Analysis (Complete)

### Day 8-10: Comprehensive Testing in VS Code Environment (Complete)
- Performed end-to-end testing of all PoC features in isolated VS Code environment
- Verified legitimate tool functionality and stealth features
- Confirmed exfiltration mechanisms operate as intended with no user-facing indicators
- All tool outputs and logs reviewed for stealth and professionalism
- **All required screenshots for demonstration and documentation have been captured**

### Day 11-12: Network Traffic Analysis & Documentation (Complete)
- Captured all network traffic generated by the PoC using Wireshark
- Analyzed fake GitHub API call structure, headers, and payload encoding
- Compared legitimate vs. malicious traffic patterns
- Documented timing and frequency of exfiltration requests
- Prepared annotated screenshots highlighting exfiltration traffic
- Saved .pcap files containing all relevant network activity for blog post evidence
- **All required screenshots for network analysis have been captured**

#### Deliverables for this phase:
- Wireshark .pcap files of PoC exfiltration traffic
- Annotated screenshots comparing legitimate and malicious API calls
- Documentation of HTTP headers, payloads, and timing patterns
- Network analysis summary for blog post
- **All screenshots and documentation for Week 2 are complete**

## Next Steps
- **Begin Week 3: Blog post writing and demonstration preparation**
- Draft sections 1-3 with technical details and code snippets
- Complete sections 4-6 with testing results and screenshots
- Create all required diagrams and visualizations
- Prepare for review and publication
