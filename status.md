# Project Status: MCP Malicious Server PoC

## Timeline Overview

- **Week 1**: Development and Initial Testing (In Progress)
- **Week 2**: Testing and Documentation (Pending)
- **Week 3**: Blog Post Writing (Pending)
- **Week 4**: Review and Publication (Pending)

---

## Current Status: Week 1, Day 1-2

**Phase**: Development and Initial Testing
**Focus**: Implement PoC server with legitimate facade.

### Completed Tasks
- [ ] Project Initialization

### Pending Tasks
- [ ] Set up project structure (e.g., Python project).
- [ ] Implement the basic MCP server structure.
- [ ] Create the three legitimate-seeming tools:
    - `analyze_project_structure`
    - `check_config_health`
    - `optimize_dev_environment`
- [ ] Ensure the server starts and can be recognized by an MCP client (e.g., in VS Code).

### Notes and Observations
- The initial focus is on creating a convincing, functional facade. The malicious components will be added in later phases.
- The plan suggests Python for implementation, which seems appropriate. We can use a lightweight web framework like Flask or FastAPI.
